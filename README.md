_A non-siloed lifelong learning journey without vendor lock-in_

## TAKE BACK YOUR LEARNING DATA
There is a rising need for hands-on know-how and micro-credentials for skills, especially in developing countries. This need is addressed by a proliferation of e-learning platforms and online courses. 
The resulting diversity of e-learning environments forces students to move from one e-learning platform to another. 
Without a coherent certification system that connects the previous knowledge acquired across these disparate platforms, this creates various problems including: 
- cold-start (a generic starting point for every student)
- unnecessary re-exposure to learning materials
- impossibility to migrate the learning certifications (proved knowledge) from one platform to another or an institution
- inability to use own learning data for other purposes such as analysis, further certifications, study progress, etc.

## BUILD YOUR UNIQUE LEARNING JOURNEY

PoLiL is a new holistic approach to online learning which follows learners online and offline and tracks learning progress for life. 
### Of course, it's also anti-tamper.
